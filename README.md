# Data-and-Sentient-analysis-with-visualizations-of-2-D-point-sequences


In Part 1, we performed a data analysis on some CSV files containing Toronto health and low income status data. In Part 2, we learned about sentiment analysis and debug a small program that analyses the sentiments found in movie reviews. In Part 3 we use loops to create some interactive visualizations of 2-D point sequences that made patterns.
